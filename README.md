# 🎨 Oddly Satisfying Canvas Playground

A tiny set of tactile, “oddly satisfying” interactions for the web. Press and drag a **squishy ball** with soft physics, tap a **ripple pool** to spawn silky rings, and click a **bouncy button** that glows and counts. Built with **React**, **HTML5 Canvas**, and a sprinkle of **Framer Motion**.
